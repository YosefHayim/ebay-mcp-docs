## Migration Guides

### Migrating from Other eBay Integrations

<Accordion title="From Direct eBay API Integration" icon="code">
  **If you're currently using eBay APIs directly:**

  **Benefits of switching:**
  - Simplified authentication (OAuth handled automatically)
  - Natural language interface via AI assistants
  - Comprehensive tool coverage (230+ operations)
  - Less code to maintain

  **Migration steps:**

  1. **Install eBay MCP Server:**
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/YosefHayim/ebay-mcp-server.git
     cd ebay-mcp-server
     npm install
     ```

  2. **Use existing credentials:**
     - Same Client ID and Secret work
     - Run `npm run setup` to configure

  3. **Replace API calls:**
     - Instead of manual API calls, use natural language with your MCP client
     - Example: "List my inventory items" instead of coding API requests

  4. **Gradual migration:**
     - Run both systems in parallel
     - Migrate one feature at a time
     - Verify functionality before switching completely
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="From eBay Official Tools" icon="store">
  **If you're using eBay Seller Hub or other official tools:**

  **Complementary usage:**
  - eBay MCP Server works alongside official tools
  - Use for automation and bulk operations
  - Official tools remain useful for manual tasks

  **Getting started:**

  1. Set up server with existing seller account
  2. Start with read-only operations (viewing inventory, orders)
  3. Gradually add write operations (creating listings, fulfilling orders)
  4. Use for repetitive tasks while keeping manual workflows
