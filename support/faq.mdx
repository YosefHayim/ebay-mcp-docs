## Authentication & Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between User Tokens and Client Credentials?" icon="shield">
    **Two authentication modes with different capabilities:**

    **User Tokens (OAuth 2.0) - Recommended:**
    - ✅ **Full API access** - all 230+ tools available
    - ✅ **High rate limits** - 10,000-50,000 requests/day
    - ✅ **User-specific operations** - manage your listings, orders, etc.
    - ✅ **Automatic refresh** - tokens renew automatically
    - ⚠️ Requires OAuth flow (one-time setup)

    **Client Credentials - Fallback:**
    - ✅ **Simple setup** - just Client ID and Secret
    - ✅ **No OAuth needed** - automatic authentication
    - ❌ **Limited rate limits** - only 1,000 requests/day
    - ❌ **Restricted access** - can't access user-specific data
    - ❌ **Fewer tools available**

    **Comparison:**

    | Feature | User Tokens | Client Credentials |
    |---------|------------|-------------------|
    | Rate Limit | 10K-50K/day | 1,000/day |
    | Setup Complexity | OAuth flow | Simple |
    | API Access | Full (230+ tools) | Limited |
    | Best For | Production use | Testing only |

    <Tip>
      The setup wizard (`npm run setup`) configures user tokens automatically.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I know if my tokens are working?" icon="check-circle">
    **Several ways to verify:**

    **1. Run configuration validator:**
    ```bash
    npm run validate-config
    ```
    This checks:
    - Credentials are valid
    - Tokens are not expired
    - API connectivity works

    **2. Check server startup logs:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Look for:
    - ✅ "Client credentials validated"
    - ✅ "User tokens loaded" (if using OAuth)
    - ✅ "230+ tools registered"

    **3. Test in MCP client:**
    - Connect your MCP client
    - Look for 🔨 tools icon
    - Try a simple operation like "List my fulfillment policies"

    **4. Check token expiry:**
    Look in your `.env` file:
    ```bash
    EBAY_USER_TOKEN_EXPIRY=2024-12-31T23:59:59.000Z
    ```
    - Access tokens: Expire in 2 hours (auto-refresh)
    - Refresh tokens: Expire in 18 months

    <Info>
      The server automatically refreshes expired access tokens using the refresh token.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often do I need to re-authenticate?" icon="calendar">
    **It depends on your authentication method:**

    **With User Tokens (OAuth):**
    - **Access tokens:** Expire every 2 hours
      - ✅ Automatically refreshed by the server
      - You don't need to do anything

    - **Refresh tokens:** Expire after 18 months
      - ⚠️ Need to re-run OAuth flow when they expire
      - You'll get an error when this happens
      - Solution: Run `npm run setup` again

    **With Client Credentials:**
    - **Never expire**
    - Automatically renewed by the server
    - No manual intervention needed

    **In practice:**
    - **Daily use:** No action needed (tokens auto-refresh)
    - **Every 18 months:** Re-run `npm run setup` for new OAuth tokens
    - **After credential changes:** Run `npm run setup` again

    <Tip>
      Set a calendar reminder for 17 months after setup to regenerate tokens before they expire.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my API data secure?" icon="lock">
    **Security measures in place:**

    **Credential Storage:**
    - ✅ Stored in `.env` file (local only)
    - ✅ `.gitignore` prevents Git commits
    - ✅ Never transmitted except to eBay APIs
    - ✅ Environment variables not logged

    **Network Security:**
    - ✅ All API calls use HTTPS encryption
    - ✅ Direct connection to eBay (no intermediaries)
    - ✅ OAuth 2.0 industry standard
    - ✅ Tokens are encrypted in transit

    **Best Practices:**

    1. **Never commit `.env` to version control:**
       ```bash
       # Check .gitignore includes .env
       cat .gitignore | grep .env
       ```

    2. **Set proper file permissions:**
       ```bash
       chmod 600 .env
       ```

    3. **Rotate credentials regularly:**
       - Regenerate every 90 days minimum
       - Immediately if compromised

    4. **Use separate credentials per environment:**
       - Different keys for Sandbox vs Production
       - Never use production keys for testing

    <Warning>
      Never share your Client Secret or tokens publicly, in screenshots, or in bug reports.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if my tokens are stolen?" icon="skull-crossbones">
    **If you suspect credential compromise:**

    **Immediate actions:**

    1. **Revoke tokens immediately:**
       - Visit [eBay Developer Portal](https://developer.ebay.com)
       - Delete or regenerate your application credentials
       - This invalidates all tokens instantly

    2. **Generate new credentials:**
       - Create new Client ID and Secret
       - Update your `.env` file
       - Run `npm run setup` with new credentials

    3. **Check for unauthorized activity:**
       - Review your eBay account for unusual changes
       - Check recent API activity in Developer Portal
       - Look for unexpected listings or orders

    4. **Secure your system:**
       - Scan for malware
       - Change passwords
       - Review who has access to your system

    **Prevention:**
    - Never commit `.env` to public repositories
    - Don't share credentials in screenshots
    - Use file permissions: `chmod 600 .env`
    - Enable 2FA on your eBay account

    **Rate limits vary by authentication method and account type:**

    **With Client Credentials:**
    - **1,000 requests per day**
    - Very limited
    - Only for testing/development

    **With User Tokens:**

    | eBay Account Type | Daily Limit |
    |------------------|-------------|
    | Basic Seller | 10,000 requests |
    | Business Seller | 25,000 requests |
    | Enterprise Seller | 50,000 requests |

    **Per-second limits:**
    - Varies by endpoint
    - Typically 10-50 requests/second
    - Server handles throttling automatically

    **What happens if I exceed limits:**
    - Get "429 Too Many Requests" error
    - Limits reset after 24 hours
    - No permanent impact

    **How to increase limits:**
    1. Upgrade from client credentials to user tokens
    2. Upgrade your eBay seller account tier
    3. Optimize your API usage (caching, batching)

    <Tip>
      Monitor your usage and upgrade to user tokens for production use.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use this server for multiple eBay accounts?" icon="users">
    **Yes, but with some configuration:**

    **Option 1: Multiple Instances**
    - Clone the server multiple times
    - Configure each with different credentials
    - Run as separate MCP servers

    ```bash
    # Structure
    ~/ebay-mcp-server-account1/
    ~/ebay-mcp-server-account2/
    ~/ebay-mcp-server-account3/
    ```

    **Option 2: Switch Credentials**
    - Use different `.env` files
    - Switch between them as needed

    ```bash
    # Maintain separate .env files
    .env.account1
    .env.account2

    # Copy the one you need
    cp .env.account1 .env
    ```

    **Option 3: Dynamic Configuration** (Advanced)
    - Modify server to accept account parameter
    - Requires code changes
    - Not officially supported yet

    **MCP Client Configuration:**
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "ebay-account1": {
          "command": "node",
          "args": ["/path/to/server1/build/index.js"]
        },
        "ebay-account2": {
          "command": "node",
          "args": ["/path/to/server2/build/index.js"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    <Note>
      Each server instance requires separate eBay API credentials and rate limits apply per account.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does this work internationally?" icon="globe">
    **Yes, the server works with eBay's global marketplaces:**

    **Supported Marketplaces:**
    - 🇺🇸 United States (eBay.com)
    - 🇬🇧 United Kingdom (eBay.co.uk)
    - 🇩🇪 Germany (eBay.de)
    - 🇦🇺 Australia (eBay.com.au)

    - 🇫🇷 France (eBay.fr)
    - 🇮🇹 Italy (eBay.it)
    - 🇪🇸 Spain (eBay.es)
    - And all other eBay marketplaces

    **How it works:**
    - Use marketplace-specific parameters in API calls
    - Tools accept `marketplace_id` parameters
    - Same credentials work across marketplaces
    - Must be authorized to sell in that marketplace

    **Example:**
    ```typescript
    // List item on eBay UK
    marketplace_id: "EBAY_GB"

    // List item on eBay Germany
    marketplace_id: "EBAY_DE"
    ```

    **Requirements:**
    - eBay seller account authorized for that marketplace
    - Appropriate marketplace settings in your account
    - Compliance with local regulations

    <Tip>
      Your eBay seller account determines which marketplaces you can access.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I automate recurring tasks?" icon="calendar-days">
    **Yes, but with important considerations:**

    **What you CAN automate:**
    - ✅ Inventory updates (bulk price changes, quantity updates)
    - ✅ Order processing (marking shipped, adding tracking)
    - ✅ Policy management (updating return/payment policies)
    - ✅ Analytics reporting (daily/weekly reports)
    - ✅ Listing refreshes (relisting ended items)

    **How to automate:**

    **Option 1: Through MCP Client**
    - Use AI assistant to perform tasks on schedule
    - Set up reminders or recurring requests
    - Limited by client capabilities

  <Accordion title="I'm getting rate limit errors" icon="gauge-high">
    **You've exceeded your daily API request limit.**

    **Quick solutions:**

    1. **Upgrade to user tokens** (if using client credentials):
       ```bash
       npm run setup
       ```
       This increases from 1,000 to 10,000+ requests/day

    2. **Wait for reset:**
       - Rate limits reset every 24 hours
       - Check when your limit resets in eBay Developer Portal

    3. **Optimize API usage:**
       - Cache responses when possible
       - Use bulk operations instead of individual calls
       - Avoid unnecessary polling

    4. **Upgrade eBay account:**
       - Business sellers get 25,000 requests/day
       - Enterprise sellers get 50,000 requests/day
