# Promoted Listings Campaigns

Promoted Listings is eBay's pay-per-sale advertising program. You only pay when an item sells.

## Creating a Campaign

```javascript
const campaign = await mcp.useTool('marketing_createCampaign', {
  campaign_name: 'High-Profit Items Campaign',
  marketplace_id: 'EBAY_US',
  funding_strategy: 'COST_PER_SALE',
  campaign_criterion: {
    criterion_type: 'INVENTORY_PARTITION',
    selection_rules: [
      {
        inventory_items: [
          { inventory_reference_id: 'WIDGET-001', inventory_reference_type: 'INVENTORY_ITEM' },
          { inventory_reference_id: 'WIDGET-002', inventory_reference_type: 'INVENTORY_ITEM' }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
});

// Set ad rate
await mcp.useTool('marketing_updateAdRate', {
  campaign_id: campaign.campaignId,
  ad_rate: 10 // 10% ad rate
});
```

## Ad Rate Recommendations

| Product Type | Suggested Ad Rate |
|--------------|-------------------|
| High-margin items (>40%) | 8-12% |
| Standard margin (20-40%) | 5-8% |
| Low-margin items (<20%) | 3-5% |
| Competitive categories | 10-15% |
| New listings | 8-10% (first 30 days) |

## Campaign Management

### Get All Campaigns

```javascript
const campaigns = await mcp.useTool('marketing_getCampaigns', {
  marketplace_id: 'EBAY_US'
});

campaigns.campaigns.forEach(campaign => {
  console.log(`${campaign.campaignName}: ${campaign.campaignStatus}`);
});
```

### Pause/Resume Campaign

```javascript
// Pause campaign
await mcp.useTool('marketing_pauseCampaign', {
  campaign_id: 'campaign_id_here'
});

// Resume campaign
await mcp.useTool('marketing_resumeCampaign', {
  campaign_id: 'campaign_id_here'
});
```
