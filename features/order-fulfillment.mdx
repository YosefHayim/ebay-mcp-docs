    ```typescript
    {

    ```

    **Returns:**
    - Buyer information

  ]
}
```bash

</Accordion>

## Shipping Fulfillment

Create shipping fulfillments to mark orders as shipped and provide tracking information to buyers.

### Creating Fulfillments

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ship Complete Order">
    Create a fulfillment for all items in an order:

    ```typescript
    {
      "orderId": "12-34567-89012",
      "fulfillment": {
        "lineItems": [
          {
            "lineItemId": "10987654321",
            "quantity": 1
          }
        ],
        "shippedDate": "2025-01-16T14:00:00.000Z",
        "shippingCarrierCode": "USPS",
        "trackingNumber": "9400111899562537717456"
      }
    }
    ```

    **Supported Carriers:**
    - USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL
    - USPS_PRIORITY, USPS_FIRST_CLASS
    - UPS_GROUND, UPS_NEXT_DAY_AIR
    - FEDEX_GROUND, FEDEX_2DAY

    **Tool:** `ebay_create_shipping_fulfillment`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Fulfillment Status">
    Check all fulfillments for an order:

    ```typescript
    {
      "orderId": "12-34567-89012"
    }
    ```

    **Tools:**
    - `ebay_get_shipping_fulfillments` - All fulfillments for order
    - `ebay_get_shipping_fulfillment` - Specific fulfillment by ID
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Important:** Always provide tracking numbers when available. Orders with tracking have lower dispute rates and better buyer satisfaction.
</Warning>

### Partial Shipments

For orders with multiple items shipped separately:

<Accordion title="Example: Split Shipment">

```typescript
// Ship first item
{
  "orderId": "12-34567-89012",
  "fulfillment": {
    "lineItems": [
      {
        "lineItemId": "10987654321",
        "quantity": 1
      }
    ],
    "shippedDate": "2025-01-16T14:00:00.000Z",
    "shippingCarrierCode": "USPS",
    "trackingNumber": "9400111899562537717456"
  }
}

// Ship second item later
{
  "orderId": "12-34567-89012",
  "fulfillment": {
    "lineItems": [
      {
        "lineItemId": "10987654322",
        "quantity": 1
      }
    ],
    "shippedDate": "2025-01-17T10:00:00.000Z",
    "shippingCarrierCode": "FEDEX",
    "trackingNumber": "779876543210"
  }
}
```markdown

**Result:** Order status becomes `FULFILLED` after all items are shipped.

</Accordion>
