---

This guide will walk you through setting up the eBay MCP Server from scratch. By the end, you'll have a fully functional MCP server connected to your AI assistant.

<Note>
  **Time to complete:** Approximately 10 minutes

  **Prerequisites:**
  - Node.js 18 or higher installed
  - Git installed
  - An eBay Developer account (we'll help you create one)
</Note>

## Step 1: Get eBay Developer Credentials

Before installing the server, you need eBay API credentials.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an eBay Developer Account">
    1. Visit the [eBay Developer Portal](https://developer.ebay.com)
    2. Click **"Register"** in the top right corner
    3. Complete the registration process
    4. Verify your email address

    <Tip>
      If you already have an eBay account, you can use those credentials to sign in.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an Application">
    1. Sign in to the [Developer Portal](https://developer.ebay.com)
    2. Navigate to **"My Account"** → **"Application Keys"**
    3. Click **"Create an Application Key"**
    4. Choose **"Production"** or **"Sandbox"** environment
    5. Fill in your application details:
       - **Application Title:** Choose a descriptive name (e.g., "My eBay MCP Server")
       - **Application Type:** Select "Public Application"

    <Warning>
      Start with the **Sandbox** environment for testing. Switch to Production when you're ready to go live.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure OAuth Settings">
    1. In your application settings, scroll to **"OAuth Redirect URIs"**
    2. Add the following redirect URI:
       ```
       http://localhost:3000/callback
       ```
    3. Click **"Save"** and note your credentials:
       - **Client ID** (App ID)
       - **Client Secret** (Cert ID)

    <Info>
      Keep these credentials secure - you'll need them in Step 3.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Grant Application Scopes">
    Ensure your application has the following scopes enabled:
    - `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.inventory`
    - `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.marketing`
    - `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.fulfillment`
    - `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.analytics.readonly`
    - `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.account`
    - `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.account.readonly`

    <Tip>
      Most of these scopes are enabled by default. Verify them in your application settings.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Install the Server

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the Repository">
    Open your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YosefHayim/ebay-mcp-server.git
    cd ebay-mcp-server
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This will install all required dependencies including the MCP SDK and eBay API client libraries.

    <Note>
      Installation typically takes 30-60 seconds depending on your internet connection.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Installation">
    Check that everything installed correctly:

    ```bash
    npm run version
    ```

    You should see version information for the eBay MCP Server.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Configure Your Credentials

The eBay MCP Server offers three configuration methods. Choose the one that works best for you.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Interactive Setup (Recommended)">
    The easiest way to configure your server with a beautiful CLI wizard.

    ```bash
    npm run setup
    ```

    The wizard will guide you through:

    1. **Environment Selection**
       - Choose between Sandbox (testing) or Production
       - The wizard validates your selection

    2. **Credential Input**
       - Enter your eBay Client ID
       - Enter your eBay Client Secret
       - Set your redirect URI (default: `http://localhost:3000/callback`)

    3. **Validation**
       - Real-time validation of your credentials
       - Checks for proper format and accessibility

    4. **OAuth Flow (Optional)**
       - Generate user tokens for full API access
       - Automatically opens your browser for authorization
       - Saves tokens securely in `.env`

    <Tip>
      The setup wizard features colorful eBay branding and clear instructions at each step.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Automatic Setup">
    If you prefer to edit the `.env` file directly first:

    1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
       ```bash
       cp .env.example .env
       ```

    2. Edit `.env` with your credentials:
       ```bash
       EBAY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
       EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
       EBAY_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
       EBAY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
       ```

    3. Run automatic setup:
       ```bash
       npm run auto-setup
       ```

    This will validate your credentials and set up OAuth tokens automatically.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Manual Configuration">
    For advanced users who want full control:

    1. Create `.env` file:
       ```bash
       cp .env.example .env
       ```

    2. Edit with all required variables:
       ```bash
       # Required
       EBAY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
       EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
       EBAY_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
       EBAY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback

       # Optional - User Tokens (for full API access)
       EBAY_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
       EBAY_USER_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
       EBAY_USER_TOKEN_EXPIRY=2024-12-31T23:59:59.000Z
       ```

    <Warning>
      Without user tokens, the server will fall back to client credentials with limited rate limits (1,000 requests/day).
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Test the Server

Before connecting to an MCP client, verify the server works:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run Tests">
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

    You should see 870+ tests passing with high coverage.

    <Tip>
      If tests fail, check your `.env` configuration and internet connection.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the Server">
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The server will start in STDIO mode, ready for MCP client connections.

    <Info>
      You should see initialization logs confirming the server is ready.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Authentication">
    The server automatically validates your credentials on startup. Check the logs for:

    - ✅ **Client credentials validated**
    - ✅ **User tokens loaded** (if configured)
    - ✅ **230+ tools registered**
  </Step>
</Steps>

          "args": ["/absolute/path/to/ebay-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
          "env": {
            "EBAY_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
            "EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret",
            "EBAY_ENVIRONMENT": "sandbox"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    <Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart Claude Desktop">
    1. Quit Claude Desktop completely
    2. Reopen Claude Desktop
    3. Look for the 🔨 tools icon - you should now see eBay tools available!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 6: Test Your First Command

Let's verify everything works by testing a simple eBay API call:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="In Claude Desktop">
    Try asking Claude:

    > "Can you list my eBay fulfillment policies?"

    Claude will use the `getFulfillmentPolicies` tool and show you your configured policies.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="In Cursor">
    In a chat, type:

    > "Show me my eBay inventory items"

    Cursor will call the `getInventoryItems` tool and display your listings.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Testing Authentication">
    Try a simple authentication check:

    > "What's the status of my eBay user token?"

    This will call `getUserTokenStatus` and confirm your authentication is working.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Check>
  **Success!** You now have a fully functional eBay MCP Server.
</Check>

## Understanding Authentication Modes

The server supports two authentication modes:

<Accordion title="User Tokens (Recommended) - 10,000-50,000 requests/day">
  **When to use:**
  - You need full API access
  - You're performing seller operations (listings, orders, etc.)
  - You want higher rate limits

  **Setup:**
  - Requires OAuth 2.0 flow (handled by `npm run setup`)
  - Tokens automatically refresh
  - Configured via `.env` file

  **Rate Limits:**
  - 10,000-50,000 requests per day (varies by eBay account type)

  <Tip>
    The interactive setup wizard (`npm run setup`) handles user token generation automatically.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Client Credentials (Fallback) - 1,000 requests/day">
  **When to use:**
  - You only need app-level operations
  - You're testing basic functionality
  - You want zero-configuration authentication

  **Setup:**
  - Automatically used if no user tokens are present
  - Only requires Client ID and Secret
  - No OAuth flow needed

  **Rate Limits:**
  - 1,000 requests per day

  **Limitations:**
  - Cannot access user-specific data
  - Limited to public/app-level operations

  <Warning>
    For most use cases, you'll want user tokens for full functionality.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Error: Invalid Client Credentials">
    **Cause:** Your Client ID or Client Secret is incorrect.

    **Solution:**
    1. Verify your credentials in the [eBay Developer Portal](https://developer.ebay.com)
    2. Make sure you're using credentials from the correct environment (Sandbox vs Production)
    3. Check for typos in your `.env` file
    4. Ensure there are no extra spaces or quotes around the values
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error: Redirect URI Mismatch">
    **Cause:** The redirect URI in your `.env` doesn't match what's configured in your eBay app.

    **Solution:**
    1. Go to your [eBay Developer Portal](https://developer.ebay.com)
    2. Navigate to your application settings
    3. Add `http://localhost:3000/callback` to OAuth Redirect URIs
    4. Save and try again
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="MCP Client Can't Find the Server">
    **Cause:** The path in your MCP client config is incorrect.

    **Solution:**
    1. Use an **absolute path** to the server (not relative)
    2. Verify the path exists: `ls /path/to/ebay-mcp-server/build/index.js`
    3. Check that you ran `npm run build` to create the build directory
    4. Restart your MCP client after config changes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate Limit Errors">
    **Cause:** You've exceeded your daily API request limit.

    **Solution:**
    - With client credentials: Upgrade to user tokens for higher limits
    - With user tokens: Wait 24 hours or upgrade your eBay seller account
    - Check your usage: Use the `getRateLimitStatus` tool (if available)

    <Tip>
      User tokens provide 10-50x more requests than client credentials.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tests Failing During Installation">
    **Cause:** Missing credentials or network issues.

    **Solution:**
    1. Configure your `.env` file before running tests
    2. Check your internet connection
    3. If using Sandbox, ensure your Sandbox credentials are valid
    4. Try running a single test: `npm test -- --run getInventoryItems.test.ts`

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need an active eBay seller account?">
    **For Sandbox:** No, you can test with just a developer account.

    **For Production:** Yes, you need an active eBay seller account to use production APIs.

    The Sandbox environment is perfect for development and testing without any seller requirements.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use this for eBay buying (not selling)?">
    No, this MCP server focuses on eBay's **Sell APIs**. It's designed for sellers to manage:
    - Inventory and listings
    - Orders and fulfillment
    - Marketing campaigns
    - Business analytics

    For buying operations, you'd need eBay's Buy APIs (not currently supported).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Sandbox and Production?">
    **Sandbox:**
    - Test environment with fake data
    - Free to use
    - No real transactions
    - Perfect for development

    **Production:**
    - Real eBay marketplace
    - Real transactions and fees
    - Requires active seller account
    - Use after thorough testing in Sandbox

    <Tip>
      Always develop and test in Sandbox before switching to Production.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I switch from Sandbox to Production?">
    1. Create Production credentials in the [eBay Developer Portal](https://developer.ebay.com)
    2. Update your `.env` file:
       ```bash
       EBAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
       EBAY_CLIENT_ID=your_production_client_id
       EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_production_client_secret
       ```
    3. Run `npm run setup` to regenerate user tokens for production
    4. Restart your MCP server

    <Warning>
      Production operations affect real listings and transactions. Test thoroughly in Sandbox first.
    </Warning>
