## Retrieving Orders

### Get All Orders

View all orders with basic filtering:

<Accordion title="Ask your AI assistant">
```
Show me all my eBay orders from the past 30 days
```
</Accordion>

The server uses `ebay_get_orders` to retrieve orders with configurable filters:
- **Date range**: Filter by creation or modification date
- **Order status**: NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, SHIPPED, CANCELLED
- **Limit and offset**: Pagination for large order volumes

<Info>
By default, eBay returns orders from the past 90 days. You can specify custom date ranges using ISO 8601 format (e.g., `2024-01-01T00:00:00Z`).
</Info>

### Filter by Status

Focus on orders requiring action:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Unfulfilled Orders">
    ```
    Show me all orders that need shipping (status: NOT_STARTED or IN_PROGRESS)
    ```
    Use this to prioritize fulfillment tasks
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Shipped Orders">
    ```
    Show me all orders I've marked as shipped in the past week
    ```
    Useful for tracking completed fulfillments
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Cancelled Orders">
    ```
    Show me cancelled orders from the past month
    ```
    Review cancellations and refund status
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Get Order Details

View complete information for a specific order:

<Accordion title="Ask your AI assistant">
```
Get full details for order ID "12-34567-89012"
```
</Accordion>

The `ebay_get_order` tool returns comprehensive data:
- **Buyer information**: Username, email, shipping address
- **Line items**: Products ordered, quantities, prices, SKUs
- **Payment details**: Total, payment method, transaction ID
- **Fulfillment status**: Shipping requirements and current state
- **Timestamps**: Order creation, payment, and modification dates

## Fulfilling Orders

### Understanding Fulfillment

A fulfillment record contains:
- **Shipping carrier**: USPS, FedEx, UPS, DHL, or other
- **Tracking number**: Package tracking identifier
- **Line items**: Which products are included in this shipment
- **Shipment date**: When the package was shipped (defaults to current time)

<Note>
For orders with multiple items, you can create partial fulfillments by shipping items separately. Each fulfillment should specify which line items it includes.
</Note>

### Create Shipping Fulfillment

Ship an order and add tracking information:

<Accordion title="Ask your AI assistant">
```
Mark order "12-34567-89012" as shipped via USPS with tracking number "9405511899223456789012"
Include all line items in this shipment
```
</Accordion>

The server will:
1. Use `ebay_create_shipping_fulfillment` to record shipment details
2. Update order status to SHIPPED
3. Send automatic notification to buyer with tracking information
4. Return fulfillment ID for your records

### Partial Fulfillment

Ship items separately when needed:

<Accordion title="Example: Multi-item order">
```
For order "12-34567-89012":
1. Ship line item 1 via UPS tracking "1Z999AA10123456784"
2. Keep line item 2 for separate shipment later
```
</Accordion>

Benefits of partial fulfillment:
- Ship available items immediately
- Send out-of-stock items when restocked
- Use different carriers for different items
- Improve buyer satisfaction with faster delivery of available products

### Supported Shipping Carriers

The eBay MCP Server supports all major carriers:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="US Carriers">
    - **USPS** (United States Postal Service)
    - **FedEx** (all services)
    - **UPS** (all services)
    - **DHL** (DHL Express, eCommerce)
    - **OnTrac** (regional)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="International">
    - **Royal Mail** (UK)
    - **Canada Post**
    - **Australia Post**
    - **Deutsche Post** (Germany)
    - **La Poste** (France)
    - And 50+ other international carriers
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Custom Carriers">
    If your carrier isn't listed, use:
    ```
    Carrier: OTHER
    Tracking: [your tracking number]
    ```
    Provide carrier name in shipping notes
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Retrieve Fulfillment History

View all fulfillments for an order:

<Accordion title="Ask your AI assistant">
```
Show me all shipping fulfillments for order "12-34567-89012"
```
</Accordion>

The `ebay_get_shipping_fulfillments` tool returns:
- Complete fulfillment history
- Tracking numbers and carrier information
- Line items included in each shipment
- Shipment dates and delivery estimates

## Handling Refunds

### When to Issue Refunds

Common refund scenarios:
- **Buyer cancellation**: Before shipment
- **Out of stock**: Cannot fulfill the order
- **Damaged in transit**: Item arrived broken
- **Wrong item shipped**: Seller error
- **Buyer return**: Item returned per return policy

### Issue Full Refund

Refund the entire order amount:

<Accordion title="Ask your AI assistant">
```
Issue a full refund for order "12-34567-89012"
Reason: Item out of stock
```
</Accordion>

The server uses `ebay_issue_order_refund` with:
- **Reason code**: OUT_OF_STOCK, BUYER_CANCEL, DAMAGE, etc.
- **Refund amount**: Automatically calculates full order total
- **Optional message**: Explain the situation to the buyer

<Warning>
Refunds are final and cannot be reversed through the API. Double-check order ID and amount before issuing refunds.
</Warning>

### Issue Partial Refund

Refund specific items or amounts:

<Accordion title="Ask your AI assistant">
```
For order "12-34567-89012", issue a partial refund:
- Refund line item 1 (damaged during shipping)
- Keep line item 2 active
- Include a $5 shipping refund for the inconvenience
```
</Accordion>

Partial refunds are useful for:
- Refunding individual items in multi-item orders
- Offering price adjustments for minor defects
- Compensating for shipping delays
- Resolving buyer complaints without full cancellation

### Refund Reasons

eBay supports these refund reason codes:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="BUYER_CANCEL">
    Buyer requested cancellation before shipment. Use this for voluntary buyer cancellations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OUT_OF_STOCK">
    Item is no longer available. Triggers inventory warnings and may affect seller metrics.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="DAMAGED">
    Item was damaged in transit or during handling. Consider requiring return photos.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="WRONG_ITEM">
    Seller shipped incorrect product. May affect seller defect rate.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="FOUND_BETTER_PRICE">
    Buyer found a better deal elsewhere. Valid reason for returns within return window.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OTHER">
    For situations not covered by standard reasons. Include detailed explanation in message.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Managing Payment Disputes

### Understanding Disputes

Payment disputes occur when:
- Buyer claims item not received (INR)
- Buyer claims item not as described (SNAD)
- Payment processor flags transaction
- Buyer initiates chargeback

<Note>
Disputes are separate from eBay's Money Back Guarantee cases. The eBay MCP Server provides tools for payment-related disputes. For eBay cases, use eBay's Resolution Center directly.
</Note>

### Retrieve Disputes

View all active disputes:

<Accordion title="Ask your AI assistant">
```
Show me all open payment disputes for my account
```
</Accordion>

Filter options:
- **Status**: OPEN, WAITING_FOR_SELLER, WAITING_FOR_BUYER, CLOSED
- **Order ID**: Disputes for specific order
- **Buyer username**: Disputes from specific buyer

### Respond to Disputes

You have two options when responding to disputes:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Accept Dispute">
    Agree with the buyer's claim and process refund:

    ```
    Accept the dispute for order "12-34567-89012"
    Issue full refund to buyer
    ```

    The server uses `ebay_accept_payment_dispute` to:
    - Close the dispute in buyer's favor
    - Process automatic refund
    - Update seller metrics
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Contest Dispute">
    Challenge the claim with evidence:

    ```
    Contest the dispute for order "12-34567-89012"
    I have proof of delivery and the buyer confirmed receipt
    ```

    The server uses `ebay_contest_payment_dispute` to:
    - Submit your response to eBay
    - Mark dispute as awaiting review
    - Allow evidence submission
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Submit Evidence

Provide documentation to support your case:

<Accordion title="Ask your AI assistant">
```
For dispute ID "5051234567", upload evidence:
- Tracking shows delivered to buyer's address on [date]
- Buyer sent message confirming receipt
- Photos of item condition before shipping
```
</Accordion>

Accepted evidence types:
- **Proof of delivery**: Tracking confirmations, signatures
- **Communications**: Messages with buyer, email confirmations
- **Product documentation**: Photos, videos, serial numbers, receipts
- **Shipping records**: Labels, weight certificates, customs forms

The server uses `ebay_add_dispute_evidence` to attach files and descriptions.

### Retrieve Dispute Activity

View complete dispute history:

<Accordion title="Ask your AI assistant">
```
Show me all activity for dispute ID "5051234567"
```
</Accordion>

Returns chronological log of:
- Dispute opening and reason

## Monitoring Seller Performance

### Key Metrics to Track

Use the eBay MCP Server to monitor:

    - Item not as described cases
    - Item not received cases
    - Low detailed seller ratings

    Target: Below 2%
  </Tab>

    ```
    What percentage of my orders were cancelled?
