# Best Practices

Follow these proven strategies to ensure secure, efficient, and reliable eBay operations with the eBay MCP Server. Learn from common pitfalls and optimize your selling workflow.

## Authentication & Security

### OAuth Token Management

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use User Tokens" icon="user-check">
    **Why:** 10,000-50,000 requests/day vs. 1,000 for client credentials

    **How:** Complete OAuth flow to obtain user tokens with full API access
  </Card>

  <Card title="Secure Token Storage" icon="lock">
    **Why:** Prevent unauthorized access to your eBay account

    **How:** Store tokens in `.env` file with `600` permissions (owner read/write only)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Rotate Tokens Regularly" icon="rotate">
    **Why:** Refresh tokens expire after 6-12 months

    **How:** Set calendar reminder to regenerate tokens before expiration
  </Card>

  <Card title="Never Commit Secrets" icon="code-branch">
    **Why:** Exposed tokens allow anyone to control your eBay account

    **How:** Verify `.env` is in `.gitignore` before every commit
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Environment Separation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Development">
    **Use:** Sandbox environment exclusively

    **Credentials:** Separate sandbox app credentials

    **Testing:** All new features, integrations, and bulk operations

    **Data:** Fake listings, test orders, mock inventory

    **Risk:** Zero - no real money or listings affected
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Production">
    **Use:** Production environment only for live operations

    **Credentials:** Production app credentials (different from sandbox)

    **Operations:** Tested and verified features only

    **Data:** Real listings, actual orders, live inventory

    **Risk:** High - affects actual transactions and seller metrics
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
**Never test in production.** A single bulk operation error could update prices on hundreds of live listings or cancel real orders.
</Warning>

### Required OAuth Scopes

Configure appropriate scopes for your operations:

```bash
# Comprehensive access (recommended for full functionality)
https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.inventory
https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.marketing
https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.account
https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.fulfillment
https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.analytics.readonly
https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.finances
https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.payment.dispute
https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.item.draft
https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.item
```yaml

<Info>
Grant only the scopes you need. For read-only operations, use `readonly` variants (e.g., `sell.inventory.readonly`) to minimize security risk.
</Info>

### Security Checklist

<Steps>
  <Step title="File Permissions">
    Set `.env` to `600` (owner read/write only):
    ```bash
    chmod 600 .env
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Git Configuration">
    Verify `.env` is gitignored:
    ```bash
    git check-ignore .env
    # Should output: .env
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Token Validation">
    Check token status regularly:
    ```text
    Ask your AI: "Check my eBay OAuth token status"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Monitoring">
    Review eBay Developer Portal > Applications > Usage for suspicious activity
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Rate Limit Optimization

### Understanding Rate Limits

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="User Tokens">
    **Daily Limits:**
    - Basic tier: 10,000 requests/day
    - Standard tier: 25,000 requests/day
    - Advanced tier: 50,000 requests/day

    **Per-Minute:** 5,000 requests/minute (all tiers)

    **Automatic:** Token refresh every ~2 hours
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Client Credentials">
    **Daily Limit:** 1,000 requests/day (all tiers)

    **Per-Minute:** 5,000 requests/minute

    **Use Case:** Fallback for read-only operations

    **Limitation:** No write operations (create, update, delete)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Rate Limit Strategy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prioritize User Tokens">
    Always use user tokens for production. Save 90% of API calls with higher limits
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Bulk Operations">
    Process 25 items in one API call instead of 25 separate calls. Multiply efficiency by 25x
  </Step>

  <Step title="Cache Data">
    Store frequently accessed data (policies, locations) locally. Don't fetch repeatedly
  </Step>

  <Step title="Implement Backoff">
    The MCP server automatically retries on 429 errors with exponential backoff. Don't fight rate limits—respect them
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Usage">
    Track daily API consumption. Set alerts at 80% of daily limit to prevent cutoffs
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Efficient API Usage Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Good: Bulk update 100 prices">
    ```yaml
    API Calls: 4 (4 batches of 25 items)
    Time: ~20 seconds
    Rate limit impact: 0.04% of daily limit (10K tier)

    Update prices for 100 SKUs using bulk_update_price_quantity
    ```

    **Efficiency:** 25 items per API call
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bad: Update 100 prices individually">
    ```yaml
    API Calls: 100 (1 per item)
    Time: ~5 minutes
    Rate limit impact: 1% of daily limit (10K tier)

    Loop through 100 SKUs calling update_price_quantity individually
    ```

    **Inefficiency:** 25x more API calls than necessary
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Good: Daily inventory sync">
    ```yaml
    Daily at 8 AM:
    1. Bulk fetch all inventory (1 API call for metadata)
    2. Compare with warehouse data (0 API calls - local processing)
    3. Bulk update only changed items (200/25 = 8 API calls)

    Total: 9 API calls for 1000-item catalog
    ```

    **Efficiency:** Sync entire catalog with <0.1% of daily limit
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bad: Real-time per-item checks">
    ```markdown
    For each sale:
    1. Get inventory item (1 API call)
    2. Update quantity (1 API call)
    3. Get updated item (1 API call)

    At 50 sales/day: 150 API calls
    ```

    **Inefficiency:** 1.5% of daily limit on simple quantity updates
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Solutions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Authentication Errors">
    **401 Unauthorized / 403 Forbidden**

    **Causes:**
    - Expired access token
    - Invalid OAuth scopes
    - Revoked app credentials

    **Solutions:**
    ```text
    Ask your AI: "Check my eBay token status"

    If expired:
    Ask your AI: "Generate new OAuth authorization URL"

    Complete OAuth flow and update .env file
    Restart MCP client
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Rate Limit Errors">
    **429 Too Many Requests**

    **Causes:**
    - Exceeded daily limit (10K-50K)
    - Exceeded per-minute limit (5K)

    **Solutions:**
    - Server automatically retries with backoff
    - Switch to user token if using client credentials
    - Spread operations across multiple days
    - Wait for limit reset (midnight Pacific Time)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Validation Errors">
    **400 Bad Request**

    **Causes:**
    - Missing required fields
    - Invalid field values
    - SKU format errors
    - Policy ID not found

    **Solutions:**
    - Read error message carefully (specifies exact issue)
    - Verify all required fields present
    - Check field formats (dates, prices, enums)
    - Test with single item before bulk operations
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Resource Errors">
    **404 Not Found**

    **Causes:**
    - SKU doesn't exist
    - Offer ID invalid
    - Campaign ID wrong
    - Wrong marketplace

    **Solutions:**
    - Verify resource IDs are correct
    - Check if resource was deleted
    - Confirm you're using correct marketplace
    - List existing resources to find correct IDs
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Error Handling Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Capture Error Details">
    The MCP server provides detailed error messages. Read them carefully—they contain the solution
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify Error Category">
    Authentication? Validation? Rate limit? Resource not found? Each has different solutions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply Appropriate Fix">
    Use error-specific solution from documentation or ask AI assistant for help
  </Step>

  <Step title="Retry with Fixed Data">
    For bulk operations, retry only failed items after fixing issues
  </Step>

  <Step title="Log and Monitor">
    Track recurring errors. Patterns indicate systematic issues requiring process changes
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing Strategy

### Development Testing

<Accordion title="Sandbox testing workflow">
```markdown
Before ANY production deployment:

1. Configure sandbox environment
   - Sandbox app credentials in .env
   - EBAY_ENVIRONMENT=SANDBOX
   - Test user tokens

2. Create test data
   - 10-20 sample listings
   - Test orders (use eBay sandbox buyer accounts)
   - Sample marketing campaigns

3. Test all operations
   - Create inventory items
   - Publish offers
   - Fulfill test orders
   - Run marketing campaigns
   - Execute bulk operations

4. Verify results
   - Check listings in sandbox Seller Hub
   - Confirm orders processed correctly
   - Review campaign metrics
   - Validate bulk operation success rates

5. Test error scenarios
   - Invalid SKUs
   - Expired tokens
   - Missing policies
   - Duplicate data

6. Switch to production ONLY after perfect sandbox performance
```bash
</Accordion>

### Automated Testing

The eBay MCP Server includes comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests (870+ tests)
npm run test

# Run with coverage reporting
npm run test:coverage
# Target: 99%+ function coverage, 85%+ line coverage

# Test specific endpoint categories
npm run test:endpoints

# Use MCP Inspector for interactive testing
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js
```yaml

<Tip>
Run tests before every deployment and after any configuration changes. Tests catch issues before they affect your eBay account.
</Tip>

</Warning>

## Data Management

### SKU Naming Conventions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Recommended Format">
    ```yaml
    Format: CATEGORY-BRAND-MODEL-VARIANT

    Examples:
    LAPTOP-DELL-XPS15-16GB-512GB
    PHONE-APPLE-14PRO-256GB-BLUE
    SHIRT-NIKE-DRYFIT-L-BLACK

    Benefits:

    - Sortable and searchable
    - Supports variant tracking
    - Scalable for large catalogs
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Avoid These">
    ```yaml
    ❌ Sequential numbers only: SKU001, SKU002
    Reason: No product information

    ❌ Special characters: LAPTOP@001, SKU#123
    Reason: API compatibility issues

    ❌ Spaces: LAPTOP 001, DELL XPS 15
    Reason: URL encoding problems

    ❌ Too long: DELL-XPS-15-9520-INTEL-CORE-I7-12700H-16GB-DDR5
    Reason: 50 character limit, hard to work with

    ❌ Random strings: FJ83KD92, XLKJ329F
    Reason: Impossible to identify products
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Inventory Management

<Steps>
  <Step title="Single Source of Truth">
    Maintain one authoritative inventory database. Sync to eBay, don't use eBay as your inventory system
  </Step>

  <Step title="Regular Synchronization">
    Sync inventory quantities daily (minimum). Real-time syncing for high-volume sellers
  </Step>

  <Step title="Buffer Stock">
    Set eBay quantities 10-20% lower than actual stock. Prevents overselling from multi-channel listings
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automated Alerts">
    Set low-stock alerts at your reorder point. Prevent out-of-stock situations
  </Step>

  <Step title="Audit Trail">
    Log all inventory changes with timestamp and reason. Essential for troubleshooting discrepancies
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Policy Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Fulfillment Policies">
    **Create:** 2-3 policies for different handling times
    - Standard: 3-5 business days
    - Expedited: 1-2 business days
    - Dropship: 5-7 business days

    **Update:** Quarterly or when shipping methods change

    **Best Practice:** Be conservative with handling times. Better to ship early than late
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Payment Policies">
    **Create:** 1-2 policies
    - Immediate payment required (recommended)
    - Payment within 2 days (for established buyers)

    **Update:** Rarely (eBay handles payment processing)

    **Best Practice:** Require immediate payment to avoid unpaid item cases
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Return Policies">
    **Create:** 2-3 policies based on category
    - 30-day returns (standard)
    - 60-day returns (competitive advantage)
    - No returns (limited items, verify category allows)

    **Update:** Annually or based on competition

    **Best Practice:** Free returns improve conversion but increase costs. Test and measure impact
  </Accordion>
