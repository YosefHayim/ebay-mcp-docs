## Promoted Listings Campaigns

### Understanding Promoted Listings

Promoted Listings is eBay's pay-per-sale advertising platform:
- **Cost**: Only pay when item sells (ad fee percentage)
- **Placement**: Higher visibility in search results and category pages
- **Control**: Set ad rates per item or campaign-wide
- **Performance**: Track impressions, clicks, and conversions

<Info>
Ad fees typically range from 2% to 20% of the sale price. eBay recommends starting at 5-8% and adjusting based on performance.
</Info>

### Create Your First Campaign

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Campaign">
    Set up campaign structure with name, marketplace, and budget
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Ad Group">
    Organize ads by category, price range, or product type
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Products">
    Select listings to promote with individual or bulk ad creation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Bids">
    Configure ad rates (percentage of sale price)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch Campaign">
    Activate and monitor performance
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 1: Create Campaign

<Accordion title="Ask your AI assistant">
```text
Create a new promoted listings campaign:
- Name: "Summer Electronics Sale 2024"
- Marketplace: EBAY_US
- Status: RUNNING
- Budget: $500 monthly cap
```markdown
</Accordion>

The server uses `ebay_create_campaign` to establish your campaign foundation. You'll receive a campaign ID for adding ads and ad groups.

### Step 2: Create Ad Group

Ad groups help organize your ads by theme or strategy:

<Accordion title="Ask your AI assistant">
```text
For my "Summer Electronics Sale 2024" campaign, create an ad group:
- Name: "Laptops - High Value"
- Default bid: 8%
- Target products: Laptops priced $800+
```markdown
</Accordion>

<Tip>
Use ad groups to test different bid strategies. For example, one group for high-margin products at 10% ad rate, another for competitive products at 5%.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Add Products to Campaign

You can add products individually or in bulk:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Individual Ads">
    For precise control over each listing:

    ```text
    Add these SKUs to my campaign with custom ad rates:
    - LAPTOP-001: 10% ad rate (high margin)
    - LAPTOP-002: 6% ad rate (competitive category)
    - LAPTOP-003: 8% ad rate (medium competition)
    ```

    The server uses `ebay_create_ad` for each listing
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Bulk Ads">
    For large catalogs:

    ```text
    Add all my laptop listings (50+ SKUs) to the campaign
    Use 7% ad rate for all items
    ```

    The server uses `ebay_bulk_create_ad_by_inventory_reference` for efficient batch creation
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Listing ID Method">
    For published listings without SKUs:

    ```text
    Add these listing IDs to my campaign:
    - 110123456789: 8% ad rate
    - 110123456790: 7% ad rate
    ```

    The server uses `ebay_create_ad_by_listing_id`
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Monitor Campaign Performance

Track how your ads are performing:

<Accordion title="Ask your AI assistant">
```text
Show me performance metrics for my "Summer Electronics Sale 2024" campaign:
- Total impressions and clicks
- Conversion rate
- Total ad fees paid
- Revenue generated
- Return on ad spend (ROAS)
```markdown
</Accordion>

The server retrieves campaign reports showing:
- **Impressions**: How many times your ads appeared
- **Clicks**: Buyer engagement with your ads
- **Sales**: Purchases attributed to ads
- **Ad Fee**: Total cost of advertising
- **Revenue**: Sales generated from ads

## Keyword Targeting

### Understanding Keywords

Keywords determine when your promoted listings appear in search results:
- **Broad Match**: Variants and related terms (e.g., "laptop" matches "gaming laptop", "laptop computer")
- **Phrase Match**: Exact phrase with additional words (e.g., "Dell laptop" matches "new Dell laptop")
- **Exact Match**: Precise term only (e.g., "Dell XPS 15" matches only "Dell XPS 15")

<Note>
eBay automatically targets relevant keywords based on your listing titles and categories. Manual keyword management provides additional control and optimization opportunities.
</Note>

### Add Keywords to Ad Group

<Accordion title="Ask your AI assistant">
```text
For my "Laptops - High Value" ad group, add these keywords:
- "gaming laptop" (Broad match, 9% bid)
- "Dell XPS laptop" (Phrase match, 8% bid)
- "MacBook Pro 16 inch" (Exact match, 10% bid)
```typescript
</Accordion>

The server uses `ebay_create_keyword` with match type specifications.

### Bulk Keyword Management

Add multiple keywords efficiently:

<Accordion title="Ask your AI assistant">
```text
Bulk add 20 laptop-related keywords to my ad group:
- All with Broad match type
- Default bid: 7%
- Include terms: ultrabook, notebook, laptop computer, portable computer, etc.
```markdown
</Accordion>

The server uses `ebay_bulk_create_keyword` for batch operations.

### Negative Keywords

Prevent ads from showing for irrelevant searches:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Campaign-Level">
    Apply negative keywords across entire campaign:

    ```text
    Add these negative keywords to my campaign:
    - "broken"
    - "parts only"
    - "for parts"
    - "not working"
    - "refurbished" (if selling new only)
    ```

    Saves budget by filtering out unprofitable searches
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Ad Group-Level">
    Fine-tune specific ad groups:

    ```text
    For my premium laptop ad group, add negative keywords:
    - "cheap"
    - "budget"
    - "under $300"
    ```

    Targets only relevant, high-value searches
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The server provides 16 tools for comprehensive negative keyword management at both campaign and ad group levels.

<Accordion title="Ask your AI assistant">
```text
Generate a campaign performance report for the past 30 days:
- Include all active campaigns
- Dimensions: Campaign, Ad Group, Keyword
- Metrics: Impressions, clicks, sales, ad fees, ROAS

<Note>

</Note>

### Key Metrics to Monitor

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Click-Through Rate (CTR)" icon="hand-pointer">
    **Formula:** (Clicks / Impressions) × 100

    **Good CTR:** 0.5% - 2%

    Low CTR suggests poor ad relevance or uncompetitive pricing
  </Card>

  <Card title="Conversion Rate" icon="chart-line">
    **Formula:** (Sales / Clicks) × 100

    **Good Rate:** 5% - 15%

    Low conversion suggests listing quality issues
  </Card>

  <Card title="Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)" icon="dollar-sign">
    **Formula:** Revenue / Ad Fees

    **Good ROAS:** 5:1 or higher

    Target varies by profit margin (higher margin = lower ROAS acceptable)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Cost per Sale" icon="receipt">
    **Formula:** Total Ad Fees / Total Sales

    **Monitor:** Against profit margin

    Ensure ad costs don't exceed your profit
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Best Practices

### Campaign Structure

<Steps>
  <Step title="Organize by Category">
    Create separate campaigns for distinct product categories (Electronics, Clothing, Home Goods) to track performance independently
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Ad Groups Strategically">
    Within campaigns, group similar items (High-End Laptops, Budget Laptops) to optimize bids by price point or margin
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Bid Strategies">
    Run small test campaigns with different bid rates to find optimal ad spend before scaling
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Daily">
    Check performance at least weekly; adjust underperforming ads or increase bids on winners
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Budget Management

<Warning>
Set monthly budgets to prevent overspending. Ad fees are charged when items sell, which can accumulate quickly during high-sales periods.
</Warning>

<Accordion title="Budget allocation strategy">
```text
Total Monthly Marketing Budget: $1,000

Allocation:
- 60% ($600): Proven campaigns (consistent ROAS > 5:1)
- 30% ($300): Growing campaigns (ROAS 3-5:1, room for optimization)
- 10% ($100): Experimental campaigns (new products, keywords, strategies)

Review and rebalance monthly based on performance
```bash
</Accordion>

### Keyword Strategy

1. **Start Broad**: Use broad match to discover what buyers search for
2. **Analyze Performance**: Review keyword reports after 2-3 weeks
3. **Refine**: Convert high-performing broad terms to phrase or exact match
4. **Add Negatives**: Filter out unprofitable or irrelevant searches
5. **Test Continuously**: Add new keywords based on search trends and competitor analysis

### Seasonal Promotions

Plan promotions around key shopping events:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Q1 (Jan-Mar)">
    - New Year sales (clearance)
    - Valentine's Day (gifts, jewelry)
    - Spring cleaning (home goods)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Q2 (Apr-Jun)">
    - Easter (seasonal items)
    - Mother's Day / Father's Day (gifts)
    - Summer preparation (outdoor gear)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Q3 (Jul-Sep)">
    - Back-to-school (electronics, supplies)

    - Halloween (costumes, decor)

    - Holiday shopping (gifts)
    - Year-end clearance
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Common Issues and Solutions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Low impressions despite high bids">
    **Problem:** Ads not showing despite competitive bid rates

    **Solution:**
    - Verify listings are active and in-stock
    - Improve listing quality (photos, titles, item specifics)
    - Check if category is eligible for promoted listings
    - Ensure campaign and ad group status is RUNNING
    - Review negative keywords (may be blocking relevant searches)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High ad spend, low sales">
    **Problem:** Many clicks but few conversions

    **Solution:**
    - Review pricing (may be too high vs. competitors)
    - Improve listing photos and descriptions
    - Check shipping costs (high shipping deters buyers)
    - Analyze keywords (attracting browsers, not buyers)
    - Add negative keywords to filter bargain hunters
    - Ensure inventory is actually available
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Campaign won't start">
    **Problem:** Campaign status stuck in PAUSED or won't activate

    **Solution:**
    - Verify ad account is approved (check Seller Hub)
    - Ensure payment method is valid
    - Check for policy violations on listed items
    - Confirm at least one ad exists in campaign
    - Review eBay marketing account standing
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error: Ad already exists">
    **Problem:** Attempting to promote already-promoted listing

    **Solution:**
    - Check existing campaigns for this listing
    - Update existing ad bid instead of creating new one
    - Remove from old campaign before adding to new one
    - Use `ebay_get_ads` to find where listing is promoted
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
