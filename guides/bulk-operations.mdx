## Inventory Bulk Operations

### Bulk Create or Replace Inventory Items

Upload large product catalogs efficiently:

<Accordion title="Ask your AI assistant">
```text
I have a CSV file with 500 products. Create inventory items for all of them:
- Each row has: SKU, Title, Description, Brand, Condition, Price, Quantity
- All items are NEW condition
- Default package weight: 1 lb
- Default package dimensions: 10x8x3 inches
```markdown
</Accordion>

The server uses `ebay_bulk_create_or_replace_inventory_item` to:
- Process up to 25 items per request
- Create new items or update existing ones (idempotent)
- Return detailed results for each item (success or error)
- Handle validation errors per-item without failing entire batch

<Info>
**Best Practice:** Split large datasets into batches of 25 items. The eBay MCP Server automatically handles batch splitting and progress tracking.
</Info>

### Bulk Retrieve Inventory Items

Fetch details for multiple SKUs:

<Accordion title="Ask your AI assistant">
```text
Retrieve inventory details for these 100 SKUs:
LAPTOP-001 through LAPTOP-100

Show me:
- Current availability and quantity
- Product condition
- Package dimensions and weight
```markdown
</Accordion>

The server uses `ebay_bulk_get_inventory_item` to retrieve multiple items efficiently.

### Bulk Update Price and Quantity

Seasonal pricing updates made easy:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Holiday Sale">
    ```text
    Update pricing for my entire electronics catalog (200+ items):
    - Reduce all prices by 15%
    - Keep quantities unchanged
    ```

    Perfect for seasonal sales and promotions
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Inventory Sync">
    ```text
    Sync quantities from my warehouse system:
    - Update 500 SKUs with new quantity values
    - Don't change prices
    ```

    Ideal for daily inventory synchronization
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Price Increase">
    ```text
    Increase prices for all items in category "Electronics":
    - Add 10% to current price
    - Update effective immediately
    ```

    Handle supplier cost increases efficiently
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The server uses `ebay_bulk_update_price_quantity` to modify pricing and stock levels across your catalog.

<Warning>
Price changes take effect immediately. Always verify your pricing data before bulk updates, especially percentage-based changes.
</Warning>

### Bulk Create Offers

Convert inventory items to active listings at scale:

<Accordion title="Ask your AI assistant">
```text
Create offers for 100 inventory items:
- SKUs: ELECTRONICS-001 through ELECTRONICS-100
- Marketplace: EBAY_US
- Format: FIXED_PRICE
- Use my default fulfillment policy
- Use my default payment policy
- Use my default return policy
- Quantity: Match inventory availability
```markdown
</Accordion>

The server uses `ebay_bulk_create_offer` to generate multiple offers simultaneously.

### Bulk Publish Offers

Launch multiple listings at once:

<Accordion title="Ask your AI assistant">
```text
Publish all unpublished offers for my summer collection:
- 50 offers across various categories
- All using SKU-based inventory references
- Publish to EBAY_US marketplace
```markdown
</Accordion>

The server uses `ebay_bulk_publish_offer` to activate multiple listings in one operation.

<Tip>
**Launch Strategy:** Create offers in advance, preview fees for each, then bulk publish all at once during peak shopping hours for maximum visibility.
</Tip>

### Bulk Migrate Legacy Listings

Modernize old listings to the Inventory API:

<Accordion title="Ask your AI assistant">
```text
Migrate my 200 legacy fixed-price listings to the Inventory API:
- Preserve all listing data (title, description, photos)
- Maintain current pricing
- Assign new SKUs based on listing IDs
- Keep listings active during migration
```markdown
</Accordion>

The server uses `ebay_bulk_migrate_listing` to convert old-format listings to modern Inventory API structure.

<Note>
Migration is a one-way operation. Once migrated, listings must be managed through Inventory API tools. Test with a small batch first.
</Note>

- NY: 4%, Tax shipping: No
- TX: 6.25%, Tax shipping: Yes
- [Continue for all 50 states]
```markdown
</Accordion>

The server uses `ebay_create_or_replace_sales_tax_table` to configure tax rates for multiple jurisdictions simultaneously.

<Info>
Sales tax rates vary by state and can change. Consult a tax professional or use eBay's automated sales tax calculation service for accuracy.
</Info>

## Bulk Operation Best Practices

### Data Preparation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Validate Data First">
    Test with 5-10 items before processing hundreds. Verify formats, required fields, and business rules
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Consistent Formats">
    Standardize SKU naming, price formats (decimal places), and text encoding (UTF-8)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Backup Before Changes">
    Export current data before bulk updates. Enables rollback if needed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Handle Errors Gracefully">
    Bulk operations return per-item status. Review failed items and retry after fixing data
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Batch Size Guidelines

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Inventory Operations">
    **Optimal batch size:** 25 items per request

    - Inventory item creation: 25 items
    - Offer creation: 25 offers
    - Price/quantity updates: 25 SKUs

    eBay's API enforces this limit
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Marketing Operations">
    **Optimal batch size:** 50-100 items per request

    - Ad creation: 100 ads
    - Keyword operations: 100 keywords
    - Bid updates: 100 modifications

    Higher limits but monitor response times
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Account Operations">
    **Optimal batch size:** All jurisdictions at once

    - Sales tax table: All states/provinces in single request
    - Policy creation: Process all policies together

    These operations are designed for complete datasets
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Error Handling Strategies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Partial Failures">
    **Scenario:** Bulk operation completes but 15 out of 100 items failed

    **Response:**
    1. Extract failed items from response
    2. Review error messages for each failure
    3. Fix data issues (invalid SKU, missing field, etc.)
    4. Retry only the failed items
    5. Don't resubmit successful items (wastes API calls)

    The eBay MCP Server provides detailed per-item results for this workflow
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Complete Failures">
    **Scenario:** Entire bulk request rejected (authentication, invalid request structure)

    **Response:**
    1. Check error message for root cause
    2. Verify OAuth token is valid and has correct scopes
    3. Validate request format (JSON structure, required fields)
    4. Test with single item first to isolate issue
    5. Retry full batch after fixing root cause
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate Limit Errors">
    **Scenario:** Hit daily API call limit during bulk operations

    **Response:**
    1. Switch to user token if using client credentials (1K → 10K+ daily limit)
    2. Spread operations across multiple days
    3. Prioritize critical updates (inventory sync over cosmetic changes)
    4. Use bulk endpoints to maximize efficiency
    5. Wait 24 hours for limit reset (resets midnight Pacific Time)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Scheduling Bulk Operations

Optimize timing for different operation types:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Off-Peak Hours">
    **Best for:** Large inventory uploads, catalog migrations

    **Timing:** 2 AM - 6 AM Pacific Time

## Common Issues and Solutions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Error: Batch size exceeded">
    **Problem:** Attempting to process more than 25 items in inventory bulk operation

    **Solution:**
    - Split data into batches of 25 items or fewer
    - Process batches sequentially
    - eBay MCP Server can handle automatic batch splitting—ask your AI assistant to "process all 500 items in appropriate batches"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error: Duplicate SKUs in batch">
    **Problem:** Same SKU appears multiple times in single bulk request

    **Solution:**
    - Deduplicate data before submission
    - Keep only the most recent/correct version
    - Use data validation tools to catch duplicates
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Warning: Some items failed">
    **Problem:** Partial success (70 succeeded, 5 failed out of 75)

    **Solution:**
    - Extract failed items from response
    - Review error messages for each
    - Common causes: missing required fields, invalid values, SKU not found
    - Fix data and retry only the failed items
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error: Rate limit exceeded mid-operation">
    **Problem:** Hit daily API limit while processing large bulk operation

    **Solution:**
    - Note which batch failed (e.g., batch 8 of 20)
    - Wait for rate limit reset (midnight Pacific Time)
    - Resume from failed batch (don't restart from beginning)
    - Consider spreading operations across multiple days
